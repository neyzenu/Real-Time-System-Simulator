# Real-Time System Simulator
ðŸ“Œ This project is a real-time simulator designed for those working on control systems and dynamic system analysis. Built with Python, this tool allows users to dynamically define transfer functions, gain values, and input signals, and visualize the system's time-domain behavior in real-time.

Features
Transfer Function Definition:

Users can input the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function.
The gain (K) value can be adjusted dynamically.
Input Signal Options:

Step
Ramp
Sinusoidal
Real-Time Graph Updates:

When parameters are changed, the system response is recalculated and visualized immediately on the graph.
User-Friendly Interface:

Simple and intuitive GUI powered by Tkinter.
System responses are visualized using Matplotlib.
Technologies and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language.
Control Systems Library: For transfer functions and system simulations.
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Installation and Usage
Install the required libraries:


pip install numpy matplotlib control
Run the project:

python main.py
Using the interface:

Input the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function.
Set the gain value.
Select the input signal type (Step, Ramp, Sinusoidal).
Observe the real-time system response in the graph.
